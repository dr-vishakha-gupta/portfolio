# 🚀 Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to analyze customer reviews. By extracting key insights from textual data, we classify sentiments and uncover trends that can help businesses **enhance customer experience, improve products, and boost engagement.**  

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
- **Understand customer sentiments** by classifying reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.  
- **Identify common themes** in customer feedback using NLP techniques.  
- **Build predictive models** to automate sentiment classification.  
- **Provide actionable recommendations** for businesses to improve customer satisfaction.  

## 📊 Data Exploration & Processing  
- **Dataset:** A collection of customer reviews with ratings.  
- **Cleaning Steps:**  
  - Removed missing values & duplicate reviews.  
  - Applied text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.  
  - Generated word clouds to visualize frequently used words.  

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Sentiment Distribution:** Majority of reviews were positive, but a significant portion expressed dissatisfaction.  
- **Common Themes:**  
  - Positive reviews praised **product quality and fast delivery.**  
  - Negative reviews often mentioned **customer service issues and product defects.**  

### **Model Performance Evaluation**
| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 85.4%    | 84.9%     | 85.6%  | 85.2%    |
| Naïve Bayes         | 83.7%    | 83.2%     | 83.9%  | 83.5%    |
| Random Forest       | 86.8%    | 86.2%     | 87.1%  | 86.6%    |
| XGBoost            | **89.2%** | **88.7%** | **89.5%** | **89.1%** |

## 🤖 Model Implementation  
- **Baseline Model:** Naïve Bayes – quick and effective for text classification.  
- **Advanced Models:**  
  - **Logistic Regression** – Balanced accuracy, interpretable.  
  - **Random Forest & XGBoost** – Improved performance but slightly overfitting.  
  - **Deep Learning (LSTM)** – Captured context but required high computational power.  
- **Best Model:** Logistic Regression achieved **85% accuracy** with optimized hyperparameters.  

## 📌 Key Findings  
- **Customers value quality & delivery speed the most.**  
- **Customer service issues are a major driver of negative reviews.**  
- **Certain product categories have more polarized reviews than others.**  
- **Emotionally charged words in reviews strongly correlate with negative feedback.**  

## 💡 Business Recommendations  
- **Enhance Customer Support:** Address recurring complaints efficiently.  
- **Monitor Sentiment in Real-Time:** Implement AI-driven monitoring for social media & reviews.  
- **Optimize Product Descriptions:** Highlight key features that customers frequently praise.  
- **Loyalty & Retention Strategy:** Engage with neutral customers to convert them into brand advocates.

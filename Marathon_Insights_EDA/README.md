# 🏃‍♂️ Marathon Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview  
Marathon running is an endurance sport that tests participants' physical and mental strength. Analyzing race data can provide valuable insights into factors affecting race completion times, demographic patterns, and performance trends.

This project focuses on **cleaning and analyzing a marathon dataset** to explore key trends and relationships between participants’ demographics, training habits, and race performance.

By performing rigorous **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, we uncover actionable insights that can aid **coaches, athletes, and race organizers** in understanding performance factors and improving race strategies.

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
The dataset underwent thorough **data preprocessing** to ensure accuracy and consistency:  
✅ **Handled missing values**: Replaced or removed incomplete records.  
✅ **Standardized categorical variables**: Unified formats for gender and other categorical fields.  
✅ **Fixed inconsistent date formats**: Ensured uniformity for race dates and training logs.  
✅ **Removed duplicates**: Eliminated redundant data entries.  
✅ **Outlier detection and treatment**: Addressed anomalies in race times and training hours.  

This ensures that the dataset is clean, structured, and ready for analysis.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
A comprehensive **EDA** was performed to uncover key patterns and trends among marathon participants:  

### **1️⃣ Age Distribution & Performance**  
📌 **Findings**:  
- The majority of marathon participants fall within the **25-40 age group**.  
- **Performance declines with age**, with younger runners achieving faster times.  

📌 **Insight**:  
- Training recommendations can be **age-specific** to optimize results for different age groups.

### **2️⃣ Gender & Completion Time Analysis**  
📌 **Findings**:  
- **Men generally have faster completion times than women**, but the gap narrows at higher experience levels.  
- Women demonstrate **more consistent pacing**, whereas men show **higher variability** in completion times.  

📌 **Insight**:  
- Training plans should be tailored based on **gender-specific endurance patterns** to improve marathon performance.

### **3️⃣ Effect of Training Hours on Race Performance**  
📌 **Findings**:  
- A strong correlation is observed between **higher training hours** and **faster race times**.  
- However, excessive training beyond a certain threshold results in **diminishing returns**.  

📌 **Insight**:  
- **Optimal training hours** need to be determined to maximize efficiency without overtraining.

### **4️⃣ Previous Marathon Experience & Race Times**  
📌 **Findings**:  
- Runners with **more marathon experience** tend to finish races **significantly faster**.  
- First-time runners show **higher variability** in race times.  

📌 **Insight**:  
- **Experience plays a critical role** in performance, indicating that structured long-term training improves results.

💡 **Business Use Cases**:  
- Coaches can **optimize training plans** using data-driven insights.  
- Marathon organizers can **predict participation trends** and improve event planning.  
- Athletes can use **personalized race strategies** for better performance.

# 🏥 Emergency Room (ER) Visits Analysis - Tableau Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Emergency Room (ER) visits are a critical component of healthcare systems, often reflecting trends in public health, patient demographics, and hospital resource utilization. 

This project analyzes **ER visit patterns**, exploring key factors such as patient demographics, frequency of visits, peak hours, and reasons for admission. The insights can help **hospital administrators, policymakers, and healthcare providers** optimize resources, improve patient care, and reduce ER overcrowding.

## 📊 Key Business Questions & Findings  

### **1️⃣ What are the peak hours and days for ER visits?**  
📌 **Findings:**  
- **Peak hours:** The highest number of ER visits occur between **6 PM and 12 AM**, indicating an increase in emergency cases during the evening.  
- **Peak days:** **Weekends (Saturday & Sunday)** show a spike in ER visits, possibly due to increased accidents, leisure activities, and limited access to primary care.  

💡 **Insight:**  
- Hospitals can **allocate more staff during peak hours** to reduce wait times.  
- Increasing awareness about **non-emergency care alternatives** could help prevent overcrowding.

### **2️⃣ Which age groups visit the ER the most?**  
📌 **Findings:**  
- The **highest ER visits are from children (0-10 years)** and **elderly patients (65+ years)**.  
- Young adults (20-40 years) have **fewer ER visits** compared to other groups.  

💡 **Insight:**  
- Pediatric and geriatric care units should be **well-equipped** to handle high patient inflow.  
- Hospitals should focus on **preventive care programs** for elderly patients to reduce emergency visits.  

---

### **3️⃣ How does gender impact ER visit trends?**  
📌 **Findings:**  
- **Women** visit the ER **more frequently** than men across all age groups.  
- The gender gap is **most significant** in the **20-40 age group**, possibly due to maternity-related visits.  

💡 **Insight:**  
- Additional **OB-GYN emergency care** may be needed to accommodate high female patient volume.  
- Gender-specific health awareness programs can be promoted.  

---

### **4️⃣ What are the most common reasons for ER visits?**  
📌 **Findings:**  
- **Injuries and respiratory issues** are the leading causes of ER visits.  
- Seasonal variations show an increase in **respiratory issues during winter months**.  

💡 **Insight:**  
- Hospitals should **increase staffing for respiratory cases** in colder months.  
- Community health programs can promote **injury prevention strategies**.  

---

### **5️⃣ Are repeat ER visits common?**  
📌 **Findings:**  
- A **significant portion of patients** have multiple ER visits within a short period, indicating **chronic conditions** or **lack of follow-up care**.  

💡 **Insight:**  
- Hospitals should implement **post-ER follow-up programs** for frequent visitors.  
- Better primary care coordination could **reduce unnecessary ER visits**.
